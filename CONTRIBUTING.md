# Development Guide

## Workflow Rules

1. **Verify Before Progressing**
   - When doing work, please run tests to confirm nothing has broken.
   - For new features, add new tests and where relevant add new documentation.

2. **Sequential Tasks**
   - When doing a sequence of tasks, please ensure all tests are passing and make a git commit before proceeding to the next task.

3. **Final Verification**
   - After completing a batch of tasks, confirm that the docker build is working.
